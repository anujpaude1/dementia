# Dementia Care Companion

**Dementia Care Companion** is an innovative mobile application designed to assist people suffering from dementia and their caretakers. This app provides a range of features to improve the quality of life for dementia patients and ensure that caretakers can provide the necessary support, safety, and care. 

## Features
